### The Test-Settings Tab
The first part of the test details page is the test-settings tab showing you some general information, 
like the *Test-Name*, the *Test-Page* which contains the Url of the application and the UI5-Version used. 

At the center of the page you can find a list of all test steps recorded. 
You can replay these steps by the button at the table toolbar. The interval each action is perform can be selected 
by the dropdown to the left with 4 different interval steps:
- **Manual**, each test step has to be executed manually by using the buttons on the list items
- **Slow**, an automatic execution of each test step with an 2 seconds delay
- **Medium**, an automatic execution of each test step with an 1 second delay
- **Fast**, an automatic execution of each test step with an half second delay

At the bottom of the page the footer you find some buttons to continue the recording and export the test.
The 3 buttons left should be self-explanatory.
